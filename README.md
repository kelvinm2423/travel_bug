Travel Bug is a one-stop web application to easily compare cities for the person that has wanderlust, new hometown mover, and curious city researcher. 

You are able to compare two different cities based on,

- Cost of Living
- Safety
- Housing
- Healthcare
- Education
- Taxation
- Commute Time

Try it out! Be on the lookout for any updates as we start planning V2!
